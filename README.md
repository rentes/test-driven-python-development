# test-driven-python-development

This repository contains all the code examples from the book "Test-Driven Python Development". The author has made available a public github repository with the code samples from the book at https://github.com/siddhi/test_driven_python/

This book explores the Test-Driven Development approach to software development, using Python 3.4. It is assumed that the reader has an intermediate understanding of the Python Programming language and its rich set of features, although the author presents a comprehensive description of these features as they are needed throughout the book.

If you're interested, get the book from Amazon: http://amzn.to/1AvKq4H

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from "Test-Driven Python Development" by Miguel Rentes (miguel.rentes@gmail.com).
